# Online-Quiz

## Description

This Project was to make an Online Quiz to help understand how to use html and javascript, interacting with more than one page and using local storage to store data. I used info from bowling because that is a passion of mine and i thought it would be cool if people learned a little more about it. This project helped me understand using functions in a diferent way by calling them on the html page rather than in the javascript file itself. I plan to use this knowledge for future projects as well as updating this one.
